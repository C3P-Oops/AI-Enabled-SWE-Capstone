## User Stories

### US-01: Applicant Data Management
As an HR Manager, I want to efficiently capture and manage applicant data to streamline the hiring process.
- Given an applicant submits their information, when the data is saved, then I should see all applicant details in the ATS
- Given an applicant's status changes, when I update the status, then it should reflect accurately in the system
- Given a large number of applications, when I use the ATS, then I should be able to perform bulk actions like job status updates

### US-02: Automated Email Notifications
As an HR Manager, I want automated email notifications to be sent to candidates, ensuring consistent communication.
- Given an applicant's status changes, when the status is updated, then an email notification should be sent automatically to the applicant
- Given a scheduled interview, when the date approaches, then a reminder email should be sent to the applicant
- Given a rejected application, when the status is marked as rejected, then an appropriate email should be sent to the applicant

### US-03: Interview Scheduling
As a Recruitment Coordinator, I want to schedule interviews through the ATS to manage logistics efficiently.
- Given an applicant needs to be interviewed, when I input their details, then the ATS should allow scheduling with a calendar API
- Given a scheduled interview, when the date is set, then all relevant stakeholders should receive a notification
- Given a change in interview schedule, when the update is made, then all involved parties should be notified of the change

### US-04: Centralized Applicant Information
As a Recruitment Coordinator, I want to access all relevant applicant information in a centralized format to streamline the hiring process.
- Given an applicant's profile, when I view it, then it should display all their submitted documents and information
- Given feedback from interviewers, when I check the applicant's profile, then I should see all feedback and notes related to the applicant
- Given an applicant's status, when I view their profile, then it should clearly show their current application status

### US-05: Comprehensive Feedback Access
As a Hiring Manager, I want to view comprehensive feedback and notes to make informed hiring decisions.
- Given an applicant has been interviewed, when I access their profile, then I should see all feedback from the interviewers
- Given multiple applicants, when I compare them, then I should easily access all feedback and notes for each candidate
- Given a decision needs to be made, when I review the notes, then I should have a clear understanding of each candidate's strengths and weaknesses

### US-06: Decision Log Maintenance
As a Hiring Manager, I want to maintain a clear decision log for each candidate to track hiring decisions and reasons.
- Given a hiring decision is made, when I record it, then the decision should be logged with a timestamp and reason
- Given a candidate's profile, when I view the decision log, then it should show all past decisions and reasons for reference
- Given multiple decision logs, when I filter them, then I should be able to sort and search by date or decision type

### US-07: Candidate Search & Filtering
As a Project Manager, I want to quickly filter and search for candidates to assemble a skilled team efficiently.
- Given a list of applicants, when I use the search function, then I should be able to filter candidates by keywords, skills, or status
- Given specific project needs, when I filter candidates, then the ATS should return a list of suitable candidates
- Given a search is performed, when results are displayed, then they should be relevant and ordered by the selected criteria

### US-08: Comprehensive Data Access
As a Project Manager, I want to access comprehensive data and interview feedback to make informed hiring decisions.
- Given an applicant's profile, when I view it, then it should include all relevant data and feedback from interviews
- Given feedback from multiple interviewers, when I review it, then I should be able to see a consolidated view of all input
- Given a hiring decision, when I make it, then it should be based on complete and accurate information from the ATS
